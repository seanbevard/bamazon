Javascript and SQL files are available in Github.

## Usage

After running bamazonCustomer.js you will be presented with all of the items in the current inventory.
Select an item by entering the item ID when prompted, and then select the quantity.  Validation requires
numerical values only.
todo:  allow ONLY item IDs that exist in the database.

If you select a quantity higher than what is available, you will receive an error and be prompted to try again.

Once a successful purchase is made, you will be presented with your total $ amount.
Then you will have the choice to view the updated inventory, or to exit.
